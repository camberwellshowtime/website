Camberwell Showtime is an annual theatrical production, written, produced and performed by the Scouts and Guides of Boroondara. Camberwell Showtime began in 1965, and in 2014 we celebrated our 50th birthday. It is the largest youth and performing arts activity in the City of Boroondara.

Camberwell Showtime is fully written and directed by young people. Most script writers and composers are cast members, aged 11-26. All the songs and scripts are written by up to 80 show members. Through music and comedy, the scripts have tackled family-oriented themes including peer pressure, conformity, consumerism, substance abuse and developing sexuality.

The show is open to young people who are active members of Scouting or Guiding and aged 11 plus by the beginning of Dress Rehearsals. Unlike other theatre groups, Camberwell Showtime accepts everyone who applies and does not audition on talent. Everyone gets a chance to perform on stage or work in one of the Technical Departments. Members of our Technical team must be aged 15 plus.

Camberwell Showtime - like Scouting and Guiding - is primarily an educational activity. The young people may focus on the fun, friendship and excitement, but the real goal is learning. Internally, and with outside assistance, both professional and volunteer, we continually strive to improve the skills of everybody involved.

The main goal of Camberwell Showtime isn't to develop young people for careers in the entertainment and media industries, but many former show members have gone on to enjoy success in these fields. Andy Lee, Steve Vizard, John Safran and Tom Gleisner have all been cast members of Camberwell Showtime, as has Tom Taylor who now writes Star Wars comics as well as his own graphic novels.
